## Q: What is Emmet?
A: Emmet is the essential toolkit for web-developers. It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code for writing HTML and CSS, based on an abbreviation structure most developers already use that expands into full-fledged HTML markup and CSS rules.


## Q: Difference between a Library and Framework?
A: A library is a collection of packages that perform specific operations whereas a framework contains the basic flow and architecture of an application. The major difference between them is the complexity. Libraries contain a number of methods that a developer can just call whenever they write code. React js is library and Angular is Framework.
The framework provides the flow of a software application and tells the developer what it needs and calls the code provided by the developer as required. If a library is used, the application calls the code from the library.


## Q: What is CDN? Why do we use it?
A: A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
The main use of a CDN is to deliver content through a network of servers in a secure and efficient way.


## Q: Why is React known as React?
A: React is named React because of its ability to react to changes in data.
React is called React because it was designed to be a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
The name "React" was chosen because the library was designed to allow developers to "react" to changes in state and data within an application, and to update the user interface in a declarative and efficient manner.
React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Facebook and an open-source developer community run it.


## Q: What is crossorigin in script tag?
A: The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. 
The purpose of crossorigin attribute is used to share the resources from one domain to another domain. Basically, it is used to handle the CORS request. It is used to handle the CORS request that checks whether it is safe to allow for sharing the resources from other domains.
### _Syntax_
```sh
<script crossorigin="anonymous|use-credentials">
```

## Q: What is difference between React and ReactDOM?
A: React is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces whereas ReactDOM is also JavaScript library that allows React to interact with the DOM.
The react package contains React.createElement(), React.Component, React.Children, and other helpers related to elements and component classes. You can think of these as the isomorphic or universal helpers that you need to build components. The react-dom package contains ReactDOM.render(), and in react-dom/server we have server-side rendering support with ReactDOMServer.renderToString() and ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup().


## Q: What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
A: Development is the stage of an application before it's made public while production is the term used for the same application when it's made public.
Development build is several times (maybe 3-5x) slower than the production build.


## Q: What is async and defer?
A: Async - The async attribute is a boolean attribute. The script is downloaded in parallel(in the background) to parsing the page, and executed as soon as it is available (do not block HTML DOM construction during downloading process ) and don’t wait for anything.
### _Syntax_
```sh
<script src="demo_async.js" async></script>
```

Defer - The defer attribute is a boolean attribute. The script is downloaded in parallel(in the background) to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing(when browser finished DOM construction). The defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM.
### _Syntax_
```sh
<script src="demo_defer.js" defer></script>
```

 ## create git repostiory(remote) ->vs code repostiory(local)---[ git init,git branch -m main,git add.,git commit -m "---",git remote add origin git@github.com:23nitgoa/Namaste-React-Learning.git,git push origin main] 


 ## Q:Difference between git and github
 A:Git is an open-source, locally installed software for version control, while GitHub is a web-based cloud service that hosts Git repositories and provides a graphical interface and additional collaboration features


## Q: What is `NPM`?
A: It is a tool used for package management and the default package manager for Node projects. NPM is installed when NodeJS is installed on a machine. It comes with a command-line interface (CLI) used to interact with the online database of NPM. This database is called the NPM Registry, and it hosts public and private 'packages.' To add or update packages, we use the NPM CLI to interact with this database. 
- `npm` alternative is `yarn`


### How to initialize `npm`?
```
npm init
```
`npm init -y` can be used to skip the setup step, `npm` takes care of it and creates the `package.json` json file automatically , but without configurations.


## Q: What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?
A: Dependencies should contain library and framework in which your app is built on, needs to function effectively. such as Vue, React, Angular, Express, JQuery and etc. 
DevDependencies should contain modules/packages a developer needs during development.
such as, parcel, webpack, vite, mocha.
These packages are necessary only while you are developing your project, not necessary on production.
To save a dependency as a devDependency on installation we need to do, 
```
npm install --save-dev
```
instead of just,
```
npm install --save
```

## Q: What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
A: Parcel/Webpack is type of a web application bundler used for development and productions purposes or power our application with different type functionalities and features.
It offers blazing fast performance utilizing multicore processing, and requires zero configuration. Parcel can take any type of file as an entry point, but an HTML or JavaScript file is a good place to start.
Parcel/Webpack are type of bundlers that we use to power our application with different type functionalities and features.
### installation commands:
- Install:
```
npm install -D parcel
```
`-D` is used for development and as a development dependency.
-for dependencies(dev and production)


## Q: What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
A: `package.json`:
* this file is mandatory for every project
* It contains basic information about the project
* Application name/version/scripts

`package-lock.json`:
* This file is automatically generated for those operations where npm modifies either the node_module tree or package-json.
* It is generated after an npm install
* It allows future devs & automated systems to download the same dependencies as the project.
* it also allows to go back to the past version of the dependencies without actual
‘committing the node_modules folder.
* It records the same version of the installed packages which allows to reinstall them.
Future installs wll be capable of building identical description tree.

**~** or **^** in `package.json` file :
These are used with the versions of the package installed.

For example  in `package.json` file:
```
"dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }
```

* **~** : “Approximately equivalent to version”, will update you to all future patch versions, without incrementing the minor version.
* **^** : “Compatible with version”, will update you to all future minor/patch versions, without incrementing the major version.

> If none of them is present , that means only the version specified in `package.json` file is used in the development.


## Q: Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
A: `package-lock.json` file contains the information about the dependencies and their versions used in the project. Deleting it would cause dependencies issues in the production environment. So don't modify it, It's being handled automatically by NPM.


## Q: What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
A: `node_modules` folder like a cache for the external modules that your project depends upon. When you npm install them, they are downloaded from the web and copied into the node_modules folder and Nodejs is trained to look for them there when you import them (without a specific path).
Don't push `node_modules`in github because it contains lots of files(more than 100 MB), it will cost you memory space.


## Q: What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
A: The .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project during commit to the repository.
The types of files you should consider adding to a .gitignore file are any files that do not need to get committed. for example, For security, the security key files and API keys should get added to the gitignore.
package-lock.json should not add into your .gitignore file.


## create servera and the app is available at local host 
npx is for excuete the npm packages

## Q: What is `npx`?
A: `npx` is a tool that is used to execute the packages. It comes with the npm, when you installed npm above with some  version then automatically npx will installed. It is an npm package runner that can execute any package that you want from the npm registry without even installing that package.

- Parcel Commands :
    - For development build:
    ```
    npx parcel <entry_point> 
    ```
    - For production build :
    ```
    npx parcel build <entry_point> 
    ```
## without cdn link using npm install the react and the react-dom
npm install react
npm install react-dom

using import we will use it in App.js => type="module"


## Q: What is `.parcel-cache`
A: `.parcel-cache` is used by parcel(bundler) to reduce the building time.
It stores information about your project when parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it doesn't have to re-parse and re-analyze everything from scratch. It's a key reason why parcel can be so fast in development mode.


### Parcel Features:
* HMR (Hot Module Replacement) - parcel keeps track of file changes via file watcher algorithm and renders the changes in the files
* File watcher algorithm - made with C++
* Minification
* Cleaning our code
* DEV and production Build
* Super fast building algorithm
* Image optimization
* Caching while development
* Compresses
* Compatible with older version of browser
* HTTPS in dev
* Port Number
